## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

<!-- TODO -->

<!-- üö´ This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` -> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user -->

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

After cloning the repo, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in each
of the variables with your information.

- `DATABASE_URL` - the connection string of either your local or the production Postgres database
- `DB_ENV` - similar to `NODE_ENV`, should be either one of "development" or "production". used to determine which database to connect to
- `JWT_SECRET` - the string to be used for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- `PORT` - number designating what port to run the backend server on
